Craft Demo: (~30mins)
Problem Statement
Design a social media posts service that supports. 
1.	CRUD features for posts. 
2.	List should return n recent posts. 
Technical/non-functional specs: 
•	JVM max heap size 128 MB
•	Keep modularity of the code in mind when designing APIs and implementation
•	Think through scalability.
•	List operation should be able to support millions of posts.
•	Feel free to use your choice of DB (in memory database is recommended)
Key assumptions: 
•	Post attributes can be similar to a Facebook post or linked post.
•	Description field supports 1000 characters.
•	More “read” requests than create/edit/delete posts.
Deliverables: 
•	No UI required and feel free to use your choice of client to demonstrate the API responses.
•	Working setup of the service (using Spring framework)
•	All features should work as expected with 200 as response code and response body containing the appropriate content. Feel free to use your choice of client.
•	Use Spring security to reject API calls to any non-existent REST endpoint with a 403 response.
•	List operation should be able to demonstrate that it can handle 1 million posts. So, have 1 million posts (with the description field containing 1000 characters) in the database prior to your demonstration. Feel free to create duplicate posts with unique identifiers.
•	API design, Database design, relationship between entities, class design, pagination concepts 
•	Unit and Integration tests
•	Assumptions, approach - for chosen libraries/frameworks, advantages and comparisons shall be clearly stated.
